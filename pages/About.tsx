              The part that might be funny, That in fact I have a bachelor
              degree in social work! <br /> Social work is awesome but I did not
              find my passion there.
              <br />
              There where the development path began. <br /> I started as a
              frontend developer through self-education, <br /> Through online
              courses and bootcamps, in addition to reading in several
              documents.
